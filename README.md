## üíª Project

A plugin designed to enhance servers by introducing boosters that multiply players' experience points. This plugin seamlessly integrates with both Minecraft XP and MCMMO skills, offering an enriched gaming experience for users.

## ‚ú® Requirements

- Minecraft 1.16+
- McMMO

## ‚öôÔ∏è Configuration

This plugin does not require any previous configuration to run, but you still have the possibility to customize almost everything about it by editing the [config.yml](#-configuration) file.

```
# There are two types of messages you can use:
#
# If you need a chat message, you just need to insert your message normally.
# If you need a title message, you must insert {@} which will divide the message in two parts: title and subtitle.
#
# 'booster_view' is a bit different and just works as a chat message. Since it throws a booster list
# I decided to provide as a StringList. I also divided into header, footer and booster item for a better
# customization.
#
# OBS: Some messages may not work with a title since it's sent to a player.

## üöÄ How to use

If you're completely beginner and don't even know how to start a minecraft server, I highly recommend you to follow the steps at [Spigot](https://www.spigotmc.org/wiki/buildtools/) before downloading this plugin.

These are the following steps to use the plugin:
1. Download [TerraPurge](https://github.com/joaocansi/terra-purge/releases)
2. Move `.jar` file to your `plugins` folder
3. Reload the server.

To give the item which purge the plot's ground use the following:
`terrapurge <player_name> <amount>`
The permission is `terrapurge.admin`
